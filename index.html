      <p>I was born in France and raised in South Texas where I currently reside with my husband and 4 week old son. 
        I love animals, which I believe is why I have 7 horses, 5 dogs, 1 cat, and 5 chickens! 
        After growing up with computer geeks as parents and surrounded by code talk, I am really looking forward to learning
        as much as possible in this class so I can get started with a real career and do some code talk of my own.</p>

      <p>Outside of class I am an avid equestrian. My main riding focus is dressage and when I'm not doing chores around the house,
        coding, or "momming", i'm riding. My goal is to go up the levels, earn my medals, and be able to train outside horses as a professional. 
        If all goes well I'll eventually have my own facility, have a full time job using the skills learned in this class and overtime as I increase my knowledge,
        and train/ride horses on the side!</p>
